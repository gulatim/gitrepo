8.If a HTTP 500 appears on a url then the url is revisited util reponse is 200
9.IF a HTTP 301 appears then the crawler tries visiting the move location.
10.If a 200 HTTP code appears the crawler exracts all the links belonging to the same domain and stores them in an unvisited list 
   and visits them sequentially

2.Handling the HTTP 500 response
3.The server returns a empty sessionid if the crawler is rerun immediately so the programs throws a index error and this has been handled
